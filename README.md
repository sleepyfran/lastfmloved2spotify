# LastFMLoved2Spotify 
![](http://forthebadge.com/images/badges/built-with-swag.svg)

A simple script that allows you to easily sync your *loved* tracks from **LastFM** into a **Spotify** playlist. ðŸŽ§

## How to run the script

### Requirements
You'll need a **LastFM API Account** that you can make over [here](https://www.last.fm/api/account/create) and a **Spotify Web API Application** which you can create [here](https://developer.spotify.com/my-applications/#!/applications/create). Be sure to save the account/application details for later, you're going to need them!

### And there we go!
**This will be available once the port is finished.**

## Hacking & requests
This is basically a quick script I made to solve my laziness of syncing my LastFM favorites with Spotify, so don't expect any pretty code! If you feel that anything should be changed I'm open to any changes. Be sure to open an issue if you miss something too!
